# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this project, I developed a simple application that allows a user to plan out their daily work schedule. When one enters the page, they are met with the full application. 

At the top of the page, the current date is displayed beneath the title and description. Beneath the header section is a table which displays the time blocks from each hour of the work day (from 9AM to 5PM). Each time block is color-coded according to whether the time slot has passed (grey), is the current hour (red), or in the future (green). 

In the center panel of each time block, there is a field for the user to enter text. In the right-most panel of each time block, there is a save button to store the inputted text. If the user enters text within the text box for a certain hour and then clicks the save button, then the inputted text will be saved to the local storage and should reappear if the page is refreshed. 


Attached below is a screenshot of the deployed application. This is what greets you as you enter the page!
